menuconfig ION
	bool "Ion Memory Manager"
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK && HAS_DMA && MMU
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	---help---
	  Chose this option to enable the ION Memory Manager,
	  used by Android to efficiently allocate buffers
	  from userspace that can be shared between drivers.
	  If you're not using Android its probably safe to
	  say N here.

config ION_SYSTEM_HEAP
	bool "Ion system heap"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the Ion system heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config ION_CARVEOUT_HEAP
	bool "Ion carveout heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable carveout heaps with Ion. Carveout heaps
	  are backed by memory reserved from the system. Allocation times are
	  typically faster at the cost of memory not being used. Unless you
	  know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CHUNK_HEAP
	bool "Ion chunk heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
          Choose this option to enable chunk heaps with Ion. This heap is
	  similar in function the carveout heap but memory is broken down
	  into smaller chunk sizes, typically corresponding to a TLB size.
	  Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CMA_HEAP
	bool "Ion CMA heap support"
	depends on ION && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable CMA heaps with Ion. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config ION_TEST
	tristate "Ion Test Device"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to create a device that can be used to test the
	  kernel and device side ION functions.

config ION_DUMMY
	bool "Dummy Ion driver"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Provides a dummy ION driver that registers the
	  /dev/ion device and some basic heaps. This can
	  be used for testing the ION infrastructure if
	  one doesn't have access to hardware drivers that
	  use ION.

config ION_TEGRA
	tristate "Ion for Tegra"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA && ION
	help
	  Choose this option if you wish to use ion on an nVidia Tegra.

config ION_NEXELL
	tristate "Ion for Nexell"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option if you wish to use ion on an Nexell SoC.

config ION_POOL_CACHE_POLICY
	bool "Ion set page pool cache policy"
	depends on ION && X86
	default y if X86
	help
	  Choose this option if need to explicity set cache policy of the
